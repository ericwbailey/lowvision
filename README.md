## Motivation

With the [upcoming Section 508 refresh](http://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh), there has been increased attention put towards blindness and low vision disabilities. Although color-blindness is a subject that is pretty well understood at this point, a lot of the existing tools that simulate low vision conditions are (unfortunately, somewhat ironically) inaccessible, many having been built on depreciated technologies or are simply no longer available online.

This project arose from a desire to address that gap by making a free, future-friendly testing tool that was built mobile-first. I wanted to make something that I would personally be comfortable using, as well as challenging myself to improve my JS skills and try out some emerging web technologies.
